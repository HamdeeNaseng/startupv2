# E-Cart Data Generator

This repository contains a Python script for generating data for an e-commerce application. The data generator can be Dockerized and run using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   ```

2. Change into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd e-cart-data-generator
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will start the required services, including the PostgreSQL database.

4. Once the services are up and running, create the necessary database tables by executing the DDL scripts provided in the previous folder. These scripts should start with "db" and include the schema creation.
   - Create a database named `PINNACLEDB`.
   - Create a schema named `ecart` within the `PINNACLEDB` database.

5. Dockerize the Python code by building the Docker image. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-ecart-data-generator .
   ```

6. Create a Docker network to allow communication between containers:
   ```bash
   docker network create my-network
   ```

7. Connect the PostgreSQL container to the Docker network. Replace `my-postgres` with the name of your PostgreSQL Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker network connect my-network my-postgres
   ```

8. Run the Docker container containing the data generator:
   ```bash
   docker run --network=my-network my-ecart-data-generator
   ```

   Note: If you are running the Python script outside of Docker, make sure to use port 5433 for the PostgreSQL connection. If running the script inside Docker, use port 5432. Modify the necessary code accordingly.

9. The data generator will start generating data for the e-commerce application based on the defined logic.
